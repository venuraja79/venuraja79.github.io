## Machine learning course for absolute beginners.

This course is designed for absolute beginners in Machine Learning (ML). No prior knowledge in ML is required. 
Basic knowledge in python will definitely help. We will also use python packages like numpy, matplotlib which you can learn 
easily by reviewing the code in this course.

This is a code-first course meaning we will implement the techniques and algorithms discussed using python for 
easier understanding rather than using mathematical notations.

**Lecture 1. Machine Learning Intuition:**

The intention here is to provide a basic intuition of **Machine Learning** (ML) that is applicable to many problems. 

When we write software, for example a sorting algorithm, we will explicitly write step-by-step instructions in a programming language 
so that the computer can execute them to achieve the desired results. However, for a class of problems such as predicting stock prices, 
identifying objects in an image etc., writing instructions or creating rules to solve them is very brittle and very hard to 
achieve even by domain experts.

Instead, we will design algorithms that 'learns' the rules from the historical data for the particular problem. We teach the 
machines how to learn from the data themselves. Please read the below notebook and feel free to play around with the code provided.
