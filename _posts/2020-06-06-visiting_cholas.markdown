## Intro

You can read about Cholas [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_dynasty)

Cholas especially medieval Cholas ruled South India for a period of 350 years. During this golden period
they built temples, dams, lakes and other [**water bodies**](https://unacademy.com/lesson/water-management-system-of-the-cholasin-tamil/6IV8XYVM) that arguably serve food for people living in Tamilnadu
today. The Kaveri delta region achieved its full glory during their reign.

Not just in water management, they have built marvelous architectural temples that still stand today 
after more than a millennium.

## Just 4 Temples

If you wish to experience first hand, the evolution (~ 250 years reduced to a day or 2 days) of Chola temple architecture 
you have to visit these 4 temples in this order.
* [Thanjavur Brihadisvara temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadisvara_Temple,_Thanjavur)
* [Gangai Konda Cholapuram temple](https://www.nativeplanet.com/travel-guide/the-world-heritage-site-of-gangaikonda-cholapuram-temple-004033.html)
* [Darasuram Airadeeswarar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airavatesvara_Temple)
* [Thirubuvanam Kampaheswarar Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampaheswarar_Temple,_Thirubuvanam)

[**Jeyamohan**](http://www.jeyamohan.in/) has recommended this in one of his speeches.

Contemporary analogy is to see how iPhone has transformed in 13 years of its existence in size and finesse.

### Day trip (better 2 days if possible)
Google map directions [**here**](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Brihadeeswara+Temple,+Membalam+Rd,+Balaganapathy+Nagar,+Thanjavur,+Tamil+Nadu+613007/Gangaikonda+Cholapuram,+Tamil+Nadu/Darasuram+Temple,+Gurunathan+Pillai+Colony,+Dharasuram,+Kumbakonam,+Tamil+Nadu/Sri+Kampahareswar+Temple,+Thirubuvanam,+Tamil+Nadu/@10.9950572,79.0179927,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m26!4m25!1m5!1m1!1s0x3baab89f48fe1221:0x1d23cb40e55d84d6!2m2!1d79.1318463!2d10.7827828!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a54d437d5de23ff:0xe1e285be9af19719!2m2!1d79.4513858!2d11.2075881!1m5!1m1!1s0x3baacd1589270ec5:0x28ecd7cf218d0edc!2m2!1d79.3575247!2d10.9484903!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a552d9b1fd3bb29:0x9fc3e9387df99b3b!2m2!1d79.4335429!2d10.9901972!3e0)

Except for Gangaikonda Cholapuram, all the other 3 temples are on the south river kaveri.

This is Thanjavur big temple. It was built by Rajaraja Chola, before the capital city
was moved to Gangaikonda Cholapuram by his son Rajendra Chola. It's amazing to know that for the rest of 250 years 
of Chola's reign it remained as its capital. You can't see any signs of it in Cholapuram, just the temple
and its ruins. 

Anyway, the focus shifts from size and grandeur to finesse at Darasuram and Thirubuvanam. The first two were
built during their ascendency (around 1000 AD) and the next two were built during the start of so called descendency
of their kingdom. (~ 1150 AD).
