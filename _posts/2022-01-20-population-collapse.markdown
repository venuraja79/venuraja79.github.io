When I step out of my semi-urban (semi-rural?) apartment block in India, I see a sea of people today
traveling by all possible means to do all sorts of things. The next thing I think of is that it must 
been like this all along and it will be so forever. Wait a sec, this can't be true! For a fact I have
read that civilization is just 5000 or so years old and earth was still in an [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period) 12,000 years ago.
This must be my naive mind (supposed to be intelligent with it's 100 billion neurons) playing tricks on me to keep me in the dark.

We are approx. [8 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population) living here today causing havoc to the natural world. Just in the 
last 2 centuries alone, the population has increased from 1 to 8 billion like never before in the history of earth. Today, we are worried about climate change,
sustainably feeding our population, saving water/air from pollution and many more issues mainly caused by the huge population. In the midst of all this 
what are the odds of someone thinking about a population decline?

Earth has witnessed a few [population declines] before. The one that we are in now will be a painful and seminal moment for us.
Anyway, the signs have been there from the 1980s if we trust what experts have to say. In [Empty Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37585564-empty-planet), the authors
claim that the population decline was set in motion the moment we turned from a rural, agricultural society to an more urban, modern society. More hands are needed to 
tend a family farm, kids are an investment. In an urban setting, they are more mouths to feed and so on. There are others
such as women empowerment, individualism, societal factors.

The first life on earth formed [4 billion years](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life-science/early-life-earth-animal-origins) ago. From there on, life
has evolved and re-evolved from very simple to extraordinarily beautiful forms that we see on earth today. Human is just one of them. New species
come to life for reasons that we can't fathom ([Cambrian Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) is an example), do their thing and die down leaving way for others. After all, earth is not just all about us.

Humans are a very recent species in earth's timeline. Homo Sapiens have been around here only for 200,000 years. We have a brain that is envy of other animals in the kingdom. Does that make us 
special? Our action here seems to suggest that earth was in penance for so long for humans to arrive and we could be the ultimate! There is no guarantee for anything here!!

The first time I heard about the term "population collapse" was two years ago from none other than Elon Musk in one of his interviews. Living in India, navigating
the never ending queues and traffic this was a huge surprise. Things started to clear once I started reading a few papers and review the data available. 
There are countries today in the world that are already in population decline or will be very soon. Most of Europe, Japan, South Korea and many more. Once the trend sets in, it
seems to be very challenging to reverse even with government policies.

Closer home, in Tamil nadu things look very normal with people everywhere. Just that looks can be deceptive. A fertility rate of 2.1 will keep the population in equilibrium. Tamil nadu's fertility rates
for the past 30 years are here. For the past 25 years or so, we are below replacement level. Our population is still increasing, although at a slower pace because of the demographic
momentum gained before 1990.

Looking forward, [peak population](https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/library/resource/population-projections-for-india-and-states-2011-2036/) is expected in 2031 and will start reducing from there on 
if the current fertility rates don't change.
